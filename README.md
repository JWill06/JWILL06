### A little bit about me!

My name is Jordan, I am a Army veteran and aspiring front-end software developer!
I have a bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in software developement. 
I am currently attending Turing School of Software and Design for front-end development.
I am familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I enjoy creating user interface applications and websites. I want to be able to make user friendly applications for those with disabilities so they can access everything almost like everyone else can! As someone with two special needs children this is one of my biggest goals as a up and coming software developer!
